# PDF Malware Detection Software 

**Overview**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying files as either benign or malicious based on various features extracted from the files. By analyzing metadata, static properties, signatures, and other attributes, the model can help identify potentially harmful files, contributing to cybersecurity efforts.


**Project Structure**

The project is organized into several key components:

***1. Feature Loading:***

JSON files containing file features are processed and converted to CSV format using provided Python scripts.
The features include information such as EXIF signatures, PDFID signatures, URI patterns, static properties, and YARA signatures.

***2. Feature Engineering:***

Relevant information is extracted from different features to create meaningful input variables for the machine learning model.
New columns are created to represent specific aspects of the features, making them suitable for training the classification model.

***3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):***

Data exploration techniques are applied to analyze the distribution and characteristics of features in benign and malicious files.
Visualizations such as scatter plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps are used to understand relationships between features and the target variable (benign/malicious).

***4. Model Selection, Training, Parameter Tuning & Results:***

The Random Forest algorithm is chosen as the classification model due to its suitability for high-dimensional data and complex relationships.

*Model Selection:*

We opted for the random forest model due to its robustness in handling higher-dimensional data (66 columns) and a large number of samples (9,500 rows), capturing complex relationships while mitigating overfitting.

*Feature Selection:*

- Lasso Regularization: Despite the largest feature set, it performed the worst, yielding a false positive rate (FP Rate) of 0.03%.
- Correlation Threshold (-0.20 to 0.20): This method produced the second-best results, with an FP Rate nearing 0.01%.
- Correlation Threshold (-0.25 to 0.25): The most effective approach, resulting in the fewest features and an FP Rate close to 0%.

Hyperparameters are tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
Model evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve, are analyzed to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying files.
